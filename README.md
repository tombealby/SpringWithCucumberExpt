# Spring With Cucumber

This project was originally created for learning how to use Cucumber with Spring.

It has since been used for practical work associated with the book 'Growing Object-Orientated
Software, Guided By Tests' by Freeman and Pryce.

To run the tests:
- run project Fake Auction: https://github.com/tombealby/FakeAuction
- run project Auction Sniper: https://github.com/tombealby/AuctionSniper
- run this project with `mvn clean install`
